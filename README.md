# Hi, I'm Joy Bose

I'm a Data Scientist and ML researcher with 15+ years of experience (10+ in machine learning), currently at Ericsson Global, Bangalore. My work spans across spiking neural networks, large language models, AI applications in various domains such as web browser and telecom.

I am building practical ML systems while staying close to neuroscience-inspired computing, brain computer interfacing and more recently LLM applications. This github has some toy projects, some code for a few research papers, and some introductory lectures I gave.
