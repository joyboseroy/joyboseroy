# Hi, I'm Joy Bose

I'm a Data Scientist and ML researcher with 15+ years of experience (10+ in machine learning), currently at Ericsson Global, Bangalore. My work spans across spiking neural networks, large language models, AI applications in various domains such as web browser.

I bridge theory and application—building practical ML systems while staying close to neuroscience-inspired computing and the evolving ethical landscape of AI.
